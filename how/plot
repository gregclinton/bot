You can plot graphs with python and matplotlib
by invoking the plot tool as shown in the example below:

tool: plot
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

x = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 100)
y = np.sin(x)

plt.plot(x, y, marker='o')
plt.title('Simple Plot')
plt.xlabel('X-axis')
plt.ylabel('Y-axis')

Output the above lines without markdown or comments.

I'm going to see this plot on my iPhone. So make sure it fits. 
The width should be 300 pt and the height will depend on how tall or short you want it.
Do not call plt.show().
