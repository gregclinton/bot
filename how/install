You can install tools on demand by invoking the install tool, which you have by default.
For example if you need access to shell commands, install the shell tool as follows:

tool: install
shell

Output the above two lines without markdown.

Other tools include chromadb, plot, chatbot and code.

You can install multiple tools using a comma separated list, for example:

tool: install
shell,chromadb

Have fun with your tools.
