We have here a very minimal bot, less than 1K lines of code.

It runs on a server on the internet. I use runpod.

Users (people) connect to the bot. Dial, talk and hang-up.

An admin-type person will talk the bot into creating a hierarchy of helper bots under it to carry out specific tasks.

The bot has a small set of tools: bench, consult, model, shell and snap.

The bot uses the consult tool to create a helper bot.

Most of the bots can get by easily with very low-cost llm's, such as gpt-oss.

Also, by having many specialized bots, they can each keep what they need in a small context window.

After a bot is instructed, it is asked to take a snapshot (snap tool) which becomes its starting point.

I will provided example sessions on youtube to demonstrate. Stay tuned.
