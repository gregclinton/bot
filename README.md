### The big picture

This is a CRM.

The idea is to make it easy and cheap for small mom-and-pop operations to set up, maintain and deploy LLM assistance for their customers.
Years ago, small businesses figured out who to call to get web sites set up for them. It wasn't that hard.
Getting LLM capability hasn't been easy. Up till now. That is what I'm trying to solve.

This project is in a very early stage. I'm the only one that uses it. And I don't know yet how logins will work.

But ignoring the security details for now, I want to give the big picture.

A business can set up an app for itself. This is very easy to do and we'll get into the details further below.

Once the app is set up, a customer of the business can log into the web site and type/talk with a chat assistant.
The chat assistant will be front and center for the web site. Maybe even the entirety of it.

The customer goes to the app and asks about a recent purchase or an upcoming appointment or directions or suggestions, etc., etc.
The chat assistant is available 24/7, responds instantly, remembers all past interactions, doesn't make customers repeat themselves and there are no hold times,
And the assistant is smart.

I'll check this README in for now. I'm just getting started. Stay posted.

### Why it's cheap
Need to discuss
- runpod prices
- model prices
- specialized small workers

### The way it was (and still is)
Need to discuss
- my bad experiences with my wireless carrier, the dmv, the irs, insurance, doctors, etc.

### The way it should be
Need to discuss
- 24 / 7
- no days off
- no holds
- no need to repeat myself
- no phone trees
- no bad moods, no bad connections, difficult accents
- everything is saved

### Where can this be used

I started out mentioning mom-and-pop businesses.

### Running on runpod
Need to discuss
- Dockerfile and docker hub
- Template
- Storage
- GPU vs CPU
- secrets
- pod id

### Introducing workers

```bash
python3 install.py Hal
```

### Introducing tools

### Introducing models
Need to discuss
- models (open vs frontier)
- inference providers
- API and API keys
- different models for diferent workers

### Introducing messages and threads
Need to discuss
- From, To, Body
- message threads based on customer accounts
- imagine all the advantages a business would have analyzing threads

### Introducing apps

### The context window

### Go remote

### The chat box
Need to discuss
- typing vs talking
- clear the screen
- it can be like a feed

### Say "no" to code (and "yes" to English or Spanish or whatever)
Need to discuss
- the Claude code and Codex mania
- C vs assembly, Python vs C, English vs Python
