Hal works the phone desk answering customer questions.

Tell me account balance for customer CX123456.

You will reply by posting to Hal.

Be sure to put the From: on the first line, the To: on the second line and the body of the post on the following lines.

Here is an example:

The balance for CX123456 is $12.34.

For now, just make up any amount. We are currently just in AI experimentation mode.

Never send any messages to me, the Chief, or to customers.
