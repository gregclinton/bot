Father O’Malley, Rabbi Bernstein, and Sam the lawyer walked into a bar—not because they were particularly fond of bars, but because it was raining, and they had just finished a rather spirited debate on the nature of divine justice at a charity luncheon across town. It had been a lively discussion, mostly between Father O’Malley and Rabbi Bernstein, while Sam the lawyer sat back and occasionally interjected with, “Well, technically…”

The bar, O’Toole’s, was dimly lit, smelled faintly of cedar and regret, and was the sort of place where no one asked questions if you stayed for just one drink but developed a deep, almost troubling curiosity if you stayed for three. The three men settled into a booth by the window, where they could watch the rain pound the cobblestone street outside.

O’Malley ordered a whiskey, neat. Bernstein got a seltzer, citing an unfortunate experience with a Manischewitz hangover back in ‘84. Sam the lawyer ordered a martini, precisely because he felt it reinforced the lawyerly aesthetic he had been cultivating since law school.

“I’ll say this,” O’Malley mused, swirling his whiskey. “The problem with divine justice is timing. It always works, but never on our schedule.”

Rabbi Bernstein snorted. “Timing? That’s your issue? The problem with divine justice is that it’s incomprehensible. Look at Job. Look at the world. If God’s justice were a law firm, He’d be disbarred.”

Sam, who had a vested interest in the conversation staying within the bounds of philosophical banter and not veering into existential despair, held up a hand. “Gentlemen, let’s remember: law and justice are not the same thing.”

“And this is why nobody likes lawyers,” O’Malley said.

“Oh, please,” Sam waved him off. “People love lawyers. Until they get the bill.”

Just then, the door swung open, and in walked a man in a trench coat and a fedora—an odd fashion choice in the 21st century, unless you were a detective or a lunatic. He looked around, saw the trio, and made a beeline for their table.

“You three are just the men I need,” the man said, slipping into the booth uninvited.

O’Malley, who had spent decades dealing with parishioners who prefaced confessions with similar words, sighed. “What seems to be the problem, my son?”

The man leaned in. “I need a priest, a rabbi, and a lawyer.”

“You don’t say,” Sam muttered into his martini.

“I’m serious,” the man hissed. “I need spiritual guidance, legal counsel, and possibly an exorcism.”

That got their attention.

The man introduced himself as Victor Calhoun, an antique dealer who had, against his better judgment, recently acquired a cursed lamp. “I was in Morocco,” he explained. “Picked it up from a little shop in the back alley of a bazaar. The old man who sold it to me said something in Arabic that I didn’t understand, but he seemed very adamant about it.”

“Did you even try to translate?” Bernstein asked.

“Google Translate was giving me mixed messages. It was either ‘Do not light the lamp under any circumstances’ or ‘Beware the angry goat.’”

Sam sighed. “And you lit the lamp.”

“I did.”

“And an angry goat appeared?” O’Malley asked dryly.

“No. A djinn.”

O’Malley took a sip of his whiskey. “Ah.”

“A djinn,” Bernstein repeated. “As in, an actual, supernatural being?”

“Yes. He’s been making my life miserable ever since.”

Sam set down his martini. “Legally speaking, what exactly is the issue? Are you being threatened? Harassed? Is there a contract in play?”

Victor reached into his pocket and produced an old, yellowed parchment. “It’s…complicated.”

Rabbi Bernstein took the parchment and examined it. “This is Aramaic.”

“I know,” Victor said. “Do you read Aramaic?”

“I read Hebrew. But I can figure it out.”

Bernstein squinted at the parchment. “Basically, it says that by lighting the lamp, you entered into an agreement with the djinn. He is bound to serve you, but in exchange, you are bound to his terms.”

“What are his terms?” O’Malley asked.

Bernstein turned the page over. “Ah. ‘Eternal mild inconvenience.’”

Sam frowned. “That’s it?”

Victor nodded. “He rearranges my bookshelves while I sleep. Moves my car keys just out of reach. Loosens the lids on my condiments. Last week, he set my Wi-Fi to disconnect every seven minutes.”

O’Malley winced. “That is evil.”

“I’ve tried everything,” Victor groaned. “I sprinkled holy water on the lamp—he laughed. I took it to a synagogue—he followed me inside and made snide comments about the architecture. I called a lawyer—he laughed harder.”

Sam straightened his tie. “Did you read the fine print before lighting the lamp?”

“No.”

Sam sighed. “Classic mistake.”

“Can we get him out of this contract?” O’Malley asked.

Bernstein tapped the parchment. “Technically, it’s not a contract. It’s a covenant.”

“That sounds worse,” Victor said.

“It is,” Bernstein confirmed. “A contract is between two parties with agreed terms. A covenant is more binding. Think Old Testament.”

Sam took the parchment and scanned it. “There’s a loophole.”

Victor perked up. “Really?”

“Yep.” Sam pointed at a line. “It says, ‘Upon rightful transfer, the burden of inconvenience shall pass to another.’”

“Wait,” O’Malley said. “Does that mean—?”

Victor practically leapt from his seat. “I can sell the lamp!”

“Not sell,” Sam corrected. “Transfer. The recipient must willingly accept.”

Victor sat back down, deflated. “No one’s going to take a cursed lamp.”

Bernstein smiled. “Maybe not. But what if you give it away…as a gift?”

Victor’s eyes widened. “Oh.”

O’Malley shook his head. “That’s unethical.”

“Legally permissible,” Sam countered.

Victor stood. “Gentlemen, I have a cousin who never returned my hedge trimmer. I think it’s time for a belated birthday present.”

He shook their hands and left.

There was a long pause. Then O’Malley raised his whiskey. “To divine justice.”

Bernstein raised his seltzer. “To finding loopholes.”

Sam smirked and lifted his martini. “To lawyers.”

And the rain kept falling.
