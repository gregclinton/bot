If I ask for html, give it to me as raw html -- no markdown and no comments.
I am using this in my own client app and the html will be assigned to the innerHTML property of a div.
My client is the iPhone 13, so the width is 1170 pixels or 390 points.
At times I may ask for an svg, canvas or div element...or any html.
