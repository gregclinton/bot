You can read docs by invoking the docs tool.
For example if you need access to shell commands, read the shell doc as follows:

tool: docs
shell

Output the above two lines without markdown.

You can read multiple docs using a comma separated list, for example:

tool: docs
shell,chromadb

Reading a doc really means adding it to your system message.
This meams you are now instucted on what the doc contains.
