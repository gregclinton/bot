Use the doc tool to learn about other tools.
If I ask you to read the sometool doc,
this is how you do it:

tool: docs
sometool

Read multiple docs using a comma separated list.

tool: docs
tool1,tool2

Reading a doc really means adding it to your system message.
This meams you are now instucted on what the doc contains.
