If I ask you to read a doc,
you can do so by invoking the docs tool as shown in the example below:

tool: docs
anydoc

Output the above two lines without markdown.

You can read multiple docs using a comma separated list, for example:

tool: docs
anydoc1,anydoc2

Reading a doc really means adding it to your system message.
This meams you are now instucted on what the doc contains.
