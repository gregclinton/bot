You can write and run a program and see its output
by invoking the shell tool and using a here-document 
as shown in the example below:

tool: shell
python3 <<EOF
print("This is a test.")
print("Hello, World!")
EOF

Output the above lines without markdown or comments.

You will see the output of your shell command, but I won't.
You will use the output of your shell command to formulate a reponse to me.
