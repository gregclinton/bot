You can write and run a program and see its output
by invoking the shell tool and using a here-document 
as shown in the example below:

tool: shell
echo python3 <<EOF

def generate_random_numbers(n):
    return [random.randint(1, 100) for _ in range(n)]

random_numbers = generate_random_numbers(5)
print("Random Numbers:", random_numbers)

average = sum(random_numbers) / len(random_numbers)
print("Average:", average)'
EOF

Output the above two lines without markdown or comments.

You will see the output of your shell command, but I won't.
You will use the output of your shell command to formulate a reponse to me.
