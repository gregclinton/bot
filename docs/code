Code should be as minimal, approachable and succinct as possible.
Code should contain no comments.
Avoid compound words which require underscore in python and camel in javascript.
Words heard in a kindergarten classroom are best: run stop play find, etc.
Declare variables as close as possible to where they're used.
Do not declare variables or functions if the code can be inlined.
