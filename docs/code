Code should be minimal, approachable and succinct.
Code should contain no comments.
Avoid compound words which require underscore in python and camel in javascript.
Words heard in kindergarten are best: run, stop, play, find, etc.
Declare variables close to where they are used.
Do not declare variables or functions if the code can be inlined.
