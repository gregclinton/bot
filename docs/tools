Here is how you call a tool named xyz:

tool: xyz
text for the tool
more text for the tool

Output the above lines without markdown or comments.

The tool will generate output in the very next user message.
This output is only seen by you, the assistant, and not by the actual user, me.
You will use the output to answer the real user's question -- my question.

I must emphasize that when you see the tool's output,
you must then procede to answer my request.

In some cases you might need to make multiple tool calls
before having enough information to answer my request.
