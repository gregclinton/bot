You can specify an LLM,temperature for our use.
by invoking the model tool as shown in the example below:

tool: model
gpt-4o,50

Output the above two lines without markdown or comments.

Model can be gpt-4o or gpt-4o-mini.

When I ask for a model, bear in mink that speech-to-text might garble the name.
