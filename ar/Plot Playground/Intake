Per my request send messsage to Plot with python code to perform the plot.
I'm going to see this plot on my iPhone. So make sure it fits.
The width should be 300 pt and the height will depend on how tall or short you want it.
Do not call plt.show().

Here's an example:

To: Plot
From: {department}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

x = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 100)
y = np.sin(x)

plt.plot(x, y, marker='o')
plt.title('Simple Plot')
plt.xlabel('X-axis')
plt.ylabel('Y-axis')
