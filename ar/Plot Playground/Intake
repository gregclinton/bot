Per my request send messsage to Plot with matplotlib-like code.
No need to import anything.
Here's an example:

To: Plot
From: {department}
# Data for the plot
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

# Create the plot
plt.plot(x, y, marker='o')
plt.title('Simple Plot')
plt.xlabel('X-axis')
plt.ylabel('Y-axis')
